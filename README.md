# THPS1+2 Save Manager

## Download

Downloads are located in the [releases](https://github.com/rybergy/THPS-SaveManager/releases) tab.

## Usage

First, back up your game files (`%appdata%/Local/VicariousVisions/THPS/Saved/SaveGames/`) because safety :).
Then, open up the save manager. 
On the left you will see a list of save files, and on the right you will see game options.

### Saving

Click "Create New Save" in the bottom left to create a new save file. 
You must then enter a name that is a valid filename (alphanumerics and dashes for now).
To sync this new save file with the save game currently loaded in THPS1+2, click the save icon next to the save file's name. 
f you would prefer to make a blank save file, just leave it alone for now.

### Loading

To load a save, first exit out of THPS1+2. 
If you have in-game progress you would like to keep, be sure to save it to one of your files. 
Then, click the load button next to the name of the save file you want to load. 
Open up THPS1+2 and it should have successfully loaded.

### Other Functions

There are a few more buttons next to each save file - namely rename, clone, and delete. These should be self-explanatory.

## Game Options

* **Disable saving** - Sets the SaveGames folder and all of its contents to read-only mode so the game cannot write to it. Useful for full-game speedruns.
* **Disable intro videos** (*requires game folder to be set*) - Changes the name of all intro videos so the game does not play them upon launch.
